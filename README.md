# Algorithm-Complexity-Analysis

Time Complexity Benchmark

Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the runtime complexity of various sorting and searching algorithms. The project was conducted as part of a university research assignment to study and compare the performance of different algorithms under various conditions.

Algorithms Tested

The following algorithms were implemented in C++ and benchmarked:

Sorting Algorithms

Insertion Sort

Selection Sort

Cocktail Sort

Bubble Sort

Searching Algorithms

Jump Search

Binary Search (Recursive)

Binary Search (Iterative)

Linear Search

Data Visualization

To better illustrate the performance differences, the results have been presented in:

Tables â€“ showcasing execution times for different input sizes.

Graphs â€“ generated using Python and the matplotlib library.
